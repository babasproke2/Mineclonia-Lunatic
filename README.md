# Mineclonia-Lunatic
Lunatic is a Mineclonia fork that creates a Touhou-themed voxel game in Luanti. This repository contains the mods, assets and other relevant files for the mod, currently in early development. Implemented features include races, flight, weapons, ammunition, items, item/weapon rarity and new "nodes" (blocks). The purpose of this game is to provide an experience that has relative feature parity with modern Minecraft, but with a Gensokyo map and a large amount of Touhou related features and content in an MMORPG style. This game uses a Gensokyo map by the Touhoucraft project, see https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/touhou-gensokyo/

# Map
The map was ported from Minecraft 1.16.2 to Mineclonia through this fork of the MC2MT tool, https://github.com/rollerozxa/MC2MT
Note: the tool was in fact forked to deal with certain errors found while attempting the conversion, the fork may be uploaded here on Github soon, but should you attempt it yourself, my methodology was to provide an AI agent the codebase and related errors, at which point it developed a fork, I recompiled the program and an output was successful
Important note: to load the map without Mineclonia's generation damaging the terrain, disable the MCL level generation flags. This will be documented more in depth at a later time.
