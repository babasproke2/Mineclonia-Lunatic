# Mineclonia-Lunatic
Lunatic is a Mineclonia fork that creates a Touhou-themed voxel game in Luanti. This repository contains the mods, assets and other relevant files for the mod, currently in early development. Implemented features include races, flight, weapons, ammunition, items, item/weapon rarity and new "nodes" (blocks). This game uses a Gensokyo map by the Touhoucraft project; check them out at https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/touhou-gensokyo/
